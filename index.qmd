::: {#hero-heading}

Hello!

I am Ji Xiaohao, a member of the Communist Party of China, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Auditing at Shandong University of Finance and Economics, specializing in Intelligent Auditing. I was awarded the recommendation for graduate studies without entrance exams based on my undergraduate GPA of 4.02/5.00 (top 2.7% in major) and continued my studies at the same institution.

I am passionate about the application of data analytics and machine learning in auditing. I have solid empirical research skills and am proficient in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL, and Power BI, capable of independently handling the full workflow of data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. Through participation in multiple research and practical projects, I have gradually gained hands-on experience in applying data analysis techniques to auditing and financial contexts.

Currently serving as Deputy Director of the Secretariat in the School of Accounting’s Graduate Student Union and Vice Class Monitor, I actively engage in student affairs and organizational coordination, with a strong emphasis on teamwork and communication efficiency.

I firmly believe that technology should serve to solve real-world problems. Going forward, I aim to become a well-rounded professional who “understands auditing, can code, and communicates clearly,” and to help drive data-informed decision-making in audit practice.
